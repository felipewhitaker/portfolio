# Portfolio

This repository contains other projects I have developed and were important for my Machine Learning journey. I have also included some projects that I have developed for classes, but that I believe are relevant to my portfolio.

They are organized by when I finished their development. I have also included a brief description of the project and the main subjects I have improved upon while developing them. 

Finally, the main subjects can be roughly divided into Machine Learning and Optimization Projects, and I believe that it is by understanding both and how they can be used that we can develop the best solutions for the problems we face.
