# Portfolio

This repository contains other projects I have developed and were important for my Machine Learning journey. I have also included some projects that I have developed for classes, but that I believe are relevant to my portfolio.

They are organized by when I finished their development. I have also included a brief description of the project and the main subjects I have improved upon while developing them. 

Finally, the main subjects can be roughly divided into Machine Learning and Optimization Projects, and I believe that it is by understanding both and how they can be used that we can develop the best solutions for the problems we face.

## Machine Learning for the Prediction of the Number of Accidents in Munich

For my application to [Digital Product School (DPS)](https://www.digitalproductschool.io/), the AI track received the challenge of predicting the `total` number of accidents (under `accident_type`) in Munich for the year of 2020. 

The main subjects I have improved upon were:

- Time Series Analysis
- Deployment of Machine Learning Models

## Neural Networks for Precipitation Seasonal Forecasting Post Processing

This project was developed for [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro](https://www.puc-rio.br/english/)'s master level Neural Networks class. It develops a post processing pipeline for precipitation numerical forecast for an area in Brazil, coordinates (-23.0, -54.0) and (-16.0, -46.0).

I believe this is the most ambitious project I have developed yet, specially because it was developed in a short period of time. The main subjects I have improved upon were:

- Neural Networks
- Bibliographic Research (on weather)

## Machine Learning Under a Modern Optimization Lens

This repository is the result of a semester at a [PUC-Rio](https://www.puc-rio.br/index.html)'s course by the same name of the book [Machine Learning Under a Modern Optimization Lens](https://www.dynamic-ideas.com/books/machine-learning-under-a-modern-optimization-lens).

The main subjects I have improved upon were:

- Optimization
- Combining Optimization and Machine Learning

## SKU level sales forecasting

This project was the result of a short two week project for a selective process. The challenge was to make SKU predictions for a Brazilian retailer.

The main subjects I have improved upon were:

- Time Series Analysis
- Communication of Results
- Data Storytelling

## Wind Speed Forecasting

This project was developed for [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro](https://www.puc-rio.br/english/)'s master level Time Series class. It compares different models - SARIMAX, VAR and Neural Networks - for wind speed forecasting.

The main subjects I have improved upon were:

- Time Series Analysis
- Technical Communication

## Maximum Coverage with Minimum Cost

This project was developed for [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro](https://www.puc-rio.br/english/)'s master level Decision and Risk Analysis class. It is a mathematical optimization model for the Maximum Coverage with Minimum Cost problem.

It has been published in the [Brazilian Operations Research Simposium (SBPO)](https://proceedings.science/sbpo/sbpo-2022) under [Cobertura Máxima e Custo Mínimo para Alocação de Recursos no Tempo (pt)](https://proceedings.science/sbpo/sbpo-2022/trabalhos/cobertura-maxima-e-custo-minimo-para-alocacao-de-recursos-no-tempo?lang=pt-br).

The main subjects I have improved upon were:

- Optimization
- Geo visualization
